# Audit Scope Enhancement - Department Selection

## Overview
Enhanced the audit creation workflow to allow users to select departments from a predefined list instead of manually typing the audit scope. This improves user experience, ensures consistency, and reduces errors.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Department Service Enhancement
**File:** `auth-service/src/services/department.service.js`
- Added `getDepartmentsByTenant()` method to fetch departments with HOD and campus information
- Exported the new method in module exports

### 2. Department Controller Enhancement
**File:** `auth-service/src/controllers/departmentController.js`
- Added `getDepartments()` method to handle GET requests for departments
- Extracts tenantId from authenticated user context
- Returns departments with related HOD and campus information

### 3. Department Routes
**File:** `auth-service/src/routes/departmentRoutes.js`
- Added GET `/departments` route to fetch departments for current tenant
- Route is accessible to all authenticated users (not restricted to SYSTEM_ADMIN)

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Department Service
**File:** `dual-dimension-consulting/src/api/departmentService.ts`
- Created comprehensive department service with TypeScript interfaces
- Methods:
  - `getDepartments()`: Fetch all departments for current tenant
  - `getDepartmentOptions()`: Get departments as select options
  - `getDepartmentsForAuditScope()`: Get departments with additional info for audit scope

### 2. AddAuditModal Enhancement
**File:** `dual-dimension-consulting/src/app/(protected)/audits/[programId]/_components/AddAuditModal.tsx`

#### Key Improvements:
- **Department Selection UI**: Replaced text input with interactive department selector
- **Checkbox Interface**: Users can select multiple departments with visual feedback
- **Real-time Scope Generation**: Automatically generates scope text from selected departments
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while fetching departments
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays selected departments as badges
- **Department Codes**: Shows department codes alongside names for better identification

#### New Features:
- **Multi-select Interface**: Checkbox-based selection for multiple departments
- **Department Badges**: Visual representation of selected departments
- **Auto-scroll**: Scrollable department list for institutions with many departments
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover states for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of department loading errors

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Users had to manually type department names
- Risk of typos and inconsistencies
- No validation of department existence
- Difficult to remember all department names

### After:
- **Visual Selection**: Users see all available departments
- **Multi-select**: Can select multiple departments easily
- **Auto-completion**: Scope text is automatically generated
- **Validation**: Only existing departments can be selected
- **Consistency**: Standardized department names across audits

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
1. Modal opens → Load departments from backend
2. User selects departments → Update selectedDepartments state
3. Generate scope text → Update formData.scope
4. Form validation → Check if departments are selected
5. Submit → Send scope text to backend

### State Management:
- `departments`: Array of available departments
- `selectedDepartments`: Array of selected department IDs
- `loadingDepartments`: Loading state for department fetch
- `formData.scope`: Generated scope text from selected departments

### Validation:
- Step 1 validation now checks `selectedDepartments.length > 0`
- Ensures at least one department is selected before proceeding

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Intuitive department selection interface
2. **Reduced Errors**: No typos or invalid department names
3. **Consistency**: Standardized department references
4. **Efficiency**: Faster audit creation process
5. **Scalability**: Works for institutions with many departments
6. **Accessibility**: Better for users with different technical levels

## Future Enhancements

1. **Department Filtering**: Add search/filter functionality for large department lists
2. **Department Categories**: Group departments by campus or function
3. **Recent Selections**: Remember frequently selected departments
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select/deselect all departments
5. **Department Status**: Show active/inactive department status

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Department Loading**: Test with various numbers of departments
2. **Selection States**: Test single and multiple department selection
3. **Scope Generation**: Verify scope text is correctly generated
4. **Form Validation**: Ensure validation works with department selection
5. **Error Handling**: Test with network errors and empty department lists
6. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Migration Notes

- Existing audits with manually typed scope will continue to work
- New audits will use the department selection interface
- No database migration required for this enhancement
- Backward compatible with existing audit data
